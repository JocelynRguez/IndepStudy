2. Independent Research or Creative Project(199IR)
· Half- or full course.
· A substantial and significant piece of original research or creative product is produced.
· Pre-requisite course work is required. Otherwise, student should take Directed Reading/199DR.

3. Directed Reading (199 DR)

Course Title (32 characters maximum)
> Enhancing AntiTuna Data-Sharing


Description of the course (please indicate if this a group independent study)
> This course is an extended research project from a summer REU at USC. Over the summer, I have worked on AuntieTuna, an anti-phasing chrome plugin that allows users to build a personalized list of sites they trust for customized protection against targeted attacks. My project this semester will build upon my previous work to improve AuntieTuna. The main focus for this course will be to improve data-sharing among users in AuntieTuna. At the end of the semester, I will learn the mechanisms used in building multi-user websites and users interact within those sites. 


Readings and Source Materials. (For Research Assistantships, describe the research project.)
>  My past accomplishments with AuntieTuna, include creating a user interface where users can interact with their individual database and implementing basic data sharing between users. For this semester, I hope to enhance the current data-sharing process through a custom website that requires users to login. That website will give users access to different users’ data. As before, I will be adding into previous source code created by graduate student at USC Calvin Ardi. 


Describe the specific work to be completed.
> At the end of the semester, I will have created a website that allows multiple users to login and access other users’ data. The minimal functions of the user website should include displaying a collective database built from each user’s personal data. Extra features can include organization features for the collective data, and improving features on current AuntieTuna plugin prototypes.
